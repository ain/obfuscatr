obuscat<span>r</span> is email address obfuscator that you can use [online](obfuscate.html "Obfuscate your email online") or on your [Mac OS X Dashboard](download.html "Download obfuscatr Dashboard widget").

Its purpose is to disguise spam bots by providing you with an encoded email that you can paste to your home page or a blog so that the email couldn't be picked up by these bots.

The code provided by obuscat<span>r</span> consists of a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag with hexadecimal representation of an email <code>mailto</code> link. As Googlebot and other bots don't render client-side scripts the email in such form will also be excluded from the search results.

As of version 1.1.0 you also have an option to encode an email without JavaScript. In this case your email will be encoded to something like <span>%6d%79%40%65%6d%61%69%6c%2e%63%6f%6d</span>. In this case a link to your email would look like this: <br /><code>&lt;a href="mailto:<span>%6d%79%40%65%6d%61%69%6c%2e%63%6f%6d</span>"&gt;Mail me&lt;a&gt;</code>.

To use this option just tick off the checkbox on the back side of the widget.
